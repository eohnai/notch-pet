# Forward Claude allowance to the notch

Needs: codex-allowance

## Goal

Forward the real Claude Code 5-hour and weekly allowance from the status line into the app, and show it next to active Claude sessions.
The forwarding must keep the user's status-line output and cancellation behavior unchanged.
It reuses the shared usage store and notch sections from [codex-allowance](codex-allowance.md). See the [usage area](area.md) for shared context.

This is a retrospective spec. It moves U2a, U2b, U2c1, U2c2, and U2c3 out of the [source specification](../notch-companion.md).
The parser, sender, and receiver exist. The forwarding wrapper and the app wiring are unfinished.

## Done when

- Claude `five_hour` and `seven_day` status-line fields become anonymous usage observations. Missing windows and reset times stay missing on their own.
- A forwarding wrapper keeps the original stdin, stdout, cancellation, and exit behavior of the status line.
  Repeated forwarding is not reported as a new provider measurement.
- Observations travel over a separate private datagram endpoint, not the lifecycle socket. Each message is at most 8192 bytes. Sending never blocks or spools.
- The running app receives these observations into the shared usage store, with the app's own receipt time.
- When the app is unavailable, the terminal still shows the original status line, with no delay beyond a fixed bound.
- Live Claude allowance appears in the actual notch beside Claude sessions, using the U5 presentation in codex-allowance.
- Several anonymous Claude sources stay separate and are labelled account unverified. Grouping by provider does not claim one shared account.
- Installed configuration changes happen only after a reviewed, reversible plan and the user's approval.

## Out of scope

- Codex allowance and the shared store's first delivery: [codex-allowance](codex-allowance.md).
- Retry, reconnect, account changes, and stale-source recovery beyond this spec's open decisions: `refresh-recovery`.
- Account identity for Claude sources. No supported source supplies it.
- Private endpoints, credentials, token-based estimates, and automatic paid prompts.

## Constraints

- Use only the status-line source accepted in [decision 0007](../../decisions/0007-read-supported-usage-data.md).
- Keep the existing Claude status-line output intact. Keep Claude lifecycle hooks separate from the quota wrapper.
- Keep quota on its own transport. Do not widen the lifecycle envelope.
- The same-user filesystem check does not authenticate a provider or prove that a measurement is fresh.
- Forwarding must work without Otty or navigation metadata, under [decision 0012](../../decisions/0012-support-terminal-independent-operation.md).

## Verify

- Seam: a fictional status-line payload through the forwarding wrapper and `UsageDelivery` to `UsageReceiver`, then `UsageStore` in the running app.
- Code: `Sources/SessionState/ClaudeUsageProvider.swift`, `UsageDelivery.swift`, `UsageReceiver.swift`, `UsageStore.swift`, and the app wiring in `Sources/NotchPet/`.
- Build: `bash scripts/run.sh --build-only`.
- Swift checks: `env DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer swift test --scratch-path /private/tmp/notch-pet-dev/build`.
- Real app: `bash scripts/run.sh`, then a live Claude status line with the reviewed configuration plan. Compare terminal output with and without forwarding.

These are reproduction commands. This retrospective spec ran documentation checks only.

## Decisions

- **Show provider-specific 5-hour and weekly limits in the notch, 2026-10-29.** Recorded in [codex-allowance](codex-allowance.md#decisions).
- [0002: Use services and shared stores](../../decisions/0002-use-mvvm-with-services.md).
- [0007: Read usage through supported interfaces](../../decisions/0007-read-supported-usage-data.md).
- [0011: Organize records by area and feature](../../decisions/0011-organize-records-by-feature.md).
- [0012: Support terminal-independent operation](../../decisions/0012-support-terminal-independent-operation.md).

## Open decisions

A code review on 2026-10-30 checked the uncommitted receiver wiring in `NotchPanelController.swift` and `NotchPetApp.swift`.
It found five gaps where no requirement exists. Each needs your choice before U2c3 continues. The options are proposals, not accepted choices.

- **Open: Usage socket providers.** The receiver accepts any provider, including `codex`. The app reads Codex itself, so a local process can replace the in-app Codex reading until the next 120-second read.
  - Accept only `claude` on the socket. Pro: closes the overwrite path. Con: a future forwarded provider needs a rule change.
  - Accept any provider but never let socket data replace an in-app source. Pro: stays general. Con: needs a source-ownership rule in the store.
- **Open: Stale usage socket recovery.** `UsageReceiver.start` refuses an existing socket file. Only a normal quit removes it. After a crash, every later start fails until a reboot or a manual delete.
  - Probe the old socket and remove it only when the connection is refused, as `EventBridgeServer` does. Pro: recovers by itself. Con: adds endpoint lifecycle code and tests.
  - Keep refusing, and report the failure with a recovery step. Pro: no new endpoint logic. Con: the user must act after every crash.
- **Open: Usage receiver health.** A start failure is dropped. `usageReceiverAvailable` is written but never read. Integration health reports only the event bridge.
  - Report usage receiver state through `IntegrationHealthController`. Pro: one place for health. Con: changes the integration-health model.
  - Show the failure only in the notch usage section. Pro: small change. Con: health stays split across two places.
- **Open: Usage source lifetime.** `UsageStore` keeps at most 128 sources and never removes one. The Claude `sourceID` scheme is not defined.
  - Use one stable `sourceID` for each Claude installation. Pro: the cap is never reached. Con: two accounts on one machine share a source.
  - Use one `sourceID` for each session, and remove sources after a fixed age. Pro: keeps sources apart. Con: needs an eviction rule and tests.
- **Open: Usage service ownership.** `NotchPanelController` owns the usage store and receiver, and `NotchUsageView` runs the Codex refresh loop.
  Decision 0002 puts I/O in services. The goal plan gave store ownership to the app.
  - Move the store, receiver, and Codex refresh into a usage service owned by `BridgeAppDelegate`. Pro: one lifecycle owner, next to the event bridge. Con: touches three app files.
  - Keep the panel as owner and move only the Codex loop out of the view. Pro: smaller change. Con: two owners for app lifecycle.

## Known code state

- The uncommitted wiring does not build. `swift build` fails at `NotchPanelController.swift:37` with `ambiguous use of 'sync(execute:)'`, because the closure returns the unused `Bool` from `apply`.
  The reviewer confirmed in a scratch copy that `_ =` fixes it. This spec records the error and does not fix it.
- The receiver handler hands each datagram to the main thread and waits, up to 32 times per read. Each one redraws the usage view.
  The ownership decision above should settle where batching happens.
- `UsageReceiver` and `UsageStore` each repeat the same input validation.

## My calls

- U2a–U2c3 move here, as the usage area file says. Their wording and checkbox states are unchanged.
- The usage-source investigation evidence for Claude stays in codex-allowance with the rest of that task. This spec cites it.
- One new task is proposed: settle the five open decisions before U2c3. It awaits your approval.
- The five gaps are recorded here because the uncommitted wiring belongs to U2c3. Codex-allowance links to the ownership decision.

## Tasks

- [x] U2a: Parse bounded Claude 5-hour/weekly status-line fields into anonymous usage observations; verify five parser tests, independent missing windows, reset units and bounded errors.
- [ ] U2b: Add a bounded Claude status-line forwarding wrapper that preserves original stdin/stdout, cancellation and exit behavior without changing installed configuration.
- [x] U2c1: Send typed quota observations through a separate bounded nonblocking Unix datagram endpoint; verify five socket/path/permission tests.
- [x] U2c2: Validate and receive bounded quota datagrams through a private receiver callback with app receipt time; verify five isolated delivery/lifecycle cases. App-store wiring remains in U2c3.
- [ ] Settle the five open usage receiver decisions (socket providers, stale socket recovery, receiver health, source lifetime, service ownership) and update U2c3's plan; proposed 2026-10-30, awaiting user approval.
- [ ] U2c3: Connect the forwarding helper and receiver, verify app-unavailable behavior and live Claude quota in the notch, and review reversible setup before any installed configuration changes.

## Evidence from the paused goal

The [paused goal log](../../goals/notch-agent-limits-log.md) adds the following. It is summarized here, not copied. None of it was rerun for this spec.

- U2a: turn 12 split U2 into parser, wrapper, and delivery tasks. Five parser tests failed first, then passed. Commit `738e0ee`.
- U2c1: turn 25 added the one-function datagram sender with five tests. Commit `ed07904`.
- U2c2: turn 26 added the three-method `UsageReceiver` with five isolated tests. Commit `ab773e6`.
- U2c3: the pause checkpoint records the uncommitted receiver wiring. Its build was interrupted, and the result was not captured.
- U2b: no wrapper exists yet. Live Claude forwarding is not verified.

## Historical evidence

The following records are copied from the [source specification](../notch-companion.md#u2a-quota-parser-verification-2026-10-29).
Only relative link paths changed. They were not rerun for this spec.
The source spec also keeps them.

### U2a quota parser verification, 2026-10-29

ClaudeUsageProvider.parse(_:sourceID:receivedAtMs:) extracts five_hour/seven_day only, converting
Unix seconds to milliseconds and preserving independently missing windows/reset times. Account
and provider measurement identity remain absent. No raw status-line content is retained.
Five ClaudeUsageProviderTests first failed the missing-type baseline, then passed with the
implementation using the isolated Swift test command and --filter ClaudeUsageProviderTests.
This verifies parsing only, not forwarding, terminal output preservation or live quota.

### U2c1 quota sender verification, 2026-10-29

UsageDelivery.send(_:endpointURL:) uses a separate Unix datagram endpoint at
/private/tmp/notch-pet-<uid>/usage-v1.sock. Each JSON observation is at most 8192 bytes.
The owned parent must be a real 0700 directory and endpoint an owned 0600 socket; symlinks
and regular files are rejected. Sending is nonblocking, with no spool, output or acknowledgement.
Five tests first failed the missing-type baseline then passed against real disposable sockets.
Datagrams keep each small quota message atomic without reusing lifecycle framing. The same-user
filesystem boundary is retained; receipt does not authenticate a provider or establish measurement freshness.
The app receiver and terminal wrapper remain unfinished. No installed configuration changed.

### U2c2 receiver verification, 2026-10-29

UsageReceiver has init/start/stop methods. Five tests first failed the missing-type baseline,
then passed against isolated Unix sockets: valid typed receipt, rejected malformed/invalid input,
private directory and existing-path preservation, second-receiver rejection/restart, and replacement
file preservation at stop. Each datagram is limited to 8192 bytes and a callback drain to 32 messages.
The receiver stamps local receipt time and never adopts an existing endpoint. Callers must stop
it at shutdown; app lifecycle integration and live Claude receipt remain U2c3 work.
