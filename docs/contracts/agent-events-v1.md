# Agent event contract, version 1

Status: accepted for the first bridge and shared-store implementations, 2026-10-22.
See [decision 0008](../decisions/0008-define-event-ordering.md).

When Claude requests command approval, the app must identify the session and distinguish that request from an old message.
This contract defines the helper's message and the receiver's handling rules.
It does not establish that the bridge, adapters, or shared store already work.

## Scope and boundaries

The helper reads one hook payload and projects only the fields listed below.
The app's agent adapter translates that projection into a shared session event.
The shared store applies the ordering and freshness rules.
Usage snapshots use a separate future contract.

Version 1 supports the seven hook names exercised in the [event investigation](../notes/agent-event-compatibility.md).
Controlled hook dispatch does not establish normal interactive Otty behavior.
`Interrupt`, `StopFailure`, notifications, MCP elicitation, and subagent lifecycle messages are outside this version.
They need coverage checks and a contract revision before acceptance.
A response stop means response ready. It does not mean task success.

## Wire message: HookEnvelopeV1

Send one UTF-8 JSON object followed by one LF byte (`0x0a`).
An envelope is a message with identity and timing fields around the projected hook data.
There is no acknowledgement or reply body.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "event_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001",
  "agent": "claude",
  "session_id": "fictional-session",
  "hook_event_name": "PermissionRequest",
  "observed_at_ms": 1000000,
  "turn_id": "fictional-turn",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "cwd": "/example/project",
  "terminal": {"kind": "otty", "pane_selector": "fictional-selector"}
}
```

The timestamp above is fictional. Actual timestamps use milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
The helper creates `event_id` once per invocation, using a random UUID.
Repeated delivery of the same message must preserve that ID and every field.
Two invocations for the same source hook can have different IDs. The store must also merge matching request identities.

| Field | Required | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | yes | Integer `1`; booleans are not integers |
| `event_id` | yes | Lowercase canonical UUID text, 36 ASCII bytes |
| `agent` | yes | `codex` or `claude` |
| `session_id` | yes | Source session ID; 1–256 UTF-8 bytes |
| `hook_event_name` | yes | One hook name from the mapping table below |
| `observed_at_ms` | yes | Integer from 0 through 9007199254740991 |
| `turn_id` | no | Source turn identity; 1–256 UTF-8 bytes |
| `tool_use_id` | no | Source tool-call identity; 1–256 UTF-8 bytes |
| `tool_name` | for tool hooks | Source tool name; 1–128 UTF-8 bytes |
| `cwd` | no | Absolute source project path; 1–4096 UTF-8 bytes |
| `terminal` | no | Exactly `kind: "otty"` and `pane_selector`, a 1–256-byte string |

Reject unknown fields, explicit nulls, duplicate object keys, invalid UTF-8, and non-finite JSON numbers.
All strings must exclude Unicode control characters and unpaired surrogates.
Count encoded UTF-8 bytes, rather than characters.
Reject oversized fields. Never truncate an identity or path.
The only nested object allowed is `terminal`; arrays are not allowed.
There is no free-form payload field.

For Claude, project `prompt_id` into `turn_id`. For Codex, project `turn_id` unchanged.
Project `tool_use_id` only when the source supplies it.
Do not invent missing source identities or a source sequence number.
`tool_name` is required for `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, and `PostToolUse`.
It is forbidden for the other hooks. `tool_use_id` is also forbidden for non-tool hooks.

Omit prompts, commands, file contents, question text, answers, assistant text, transcript paths, credentials, and raw tool input.
Do not open a transcript to fill a missing field.
These omissions keep the contract small and avoid copying conversation content.

### Hook mapping: SourceHookV1

| Hook | Shared meaning | Additional rule |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Session observed idle | Not a heartbeat or a source sequence boundary |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | A turn started | Supplies the baseline for working state |
| `PreToolUse` | Tool observed | Does not itself clear any input request |
| `PermissionRequest` | Approval needed | Classify question tools before command approval |
| `PostToolUse` | Tool finished | Clears only a matching request |
| `Stop` | Response ready | Clears requests only for the matching current turn |
| `SessionEnd` | Session ended | Creates a terminal record for this app run |

Codex `request_user_input` and Claude `AskUserQuestion` identify structured questions.
A `PreToolUse` or `PermissionRequest` for either provider's matching tool means question needed.
Other `PermissionRequest` events mean approval needed.
Repeated question openings for the same tool call produce one request.
A permission event without a tool-call ID must not be guessed to match another opening.
Natural-language questions remain response ready when no dedicated source event identifies them.

## Identity and evidence

The session key is `(agent, session_id)`. A folder, process ID, or pane selector is not a session key.
Equal session IDs from different agents remain separate.
Two source session IDs in the same folder also remain separate.

The request key is `(current turn, tool_use_id)` when both identities are available.
Otherwise, retain an uncorrelated request keyed by `event_id`.
Different requests must not overwrite each other.
A repeated opening with the same request key merges into the existing request.
If its request kind changes, mark the session unknown instead of replacing the request.
A matching `PostToolUse` needs the same turn, tool-call ID, and tool name.
Do not clear an uncorrelated request using a guessed match.
A correlated `Stop` for the current turn can clear all that turn's requests, including uncorrelated tool calls.
Without matching turn identity, it cannot clear requests.

`terminal` is an unverified navigation hint.
It never proves freshness, working state, account identity, or permission.
The future terminal adapter must validate it against live Otty state and this source session.
Absent, closed, stale, or ambiguous matches make navigation unavailable.
Never open a replacement pane automatically.

## Ordering and shared state: SessionObservationV1

Hooks do not supply a verified total source order.
The helper's timestamp records when it read the hook, not when the agent produced it.
Receipt order and UUID order cannot establish source order.
Normal compatible transitions below are provisional observations, bounded by freshness.
They are not a guarantee of complete or ordered delivery.

The store keeps a capture-time watermark, current turn, known retired turns, pending requests, and seen event IDs per session.
It also keeps receipt time and a monotonic expiry deadline.
A monotonic clock measures elapsed time without wall-clock adjustments.

Apply these rules in order:

1. Reject invalid or expired messages before changing session state.
2. Ignore an identical previously seen event ID. Do not refresh its deadline.
3. If that ID has different contents, mark its session unknown. Retain its pending requests without refreshing freshness.
4. A valid `SessionEnd` takes priority. Set ended, clear requests, and retain a terminal record until app exit.
5. After end, ignore activity. A later `SessionStart` with the same ID sets unknown with reason `reused_session_id`.
6. Keep that terminal restriction after a repeated start. Version 1 cannot verify a resumed lifecycle with the same ID.
7. For any other unseen event, compare `observed_at_ms` with the watermark.
8. An equal or lower timestamp is ambiguous. Mark unknown, retain requests, and do not advance the deadline or watermark.
9. An event for a retired turn is delayed. Ignore it without refreshing freshness.
10. Apply a compatible transition below. Conflicts set unknown and retain unresolved requests.
11. Advance the watermark and deadline only for a compatible, state-bearing observation.

Unresolved input has presentation priority over response-ready state.
When a session becomes unknown, retain unresolved requests as unconfirmed notices.
Do not present those notices as current approval or current question requests.

| Incoming event | Compatible transition |
|---|---|
| First `SessionStart` | Idle; a repeated start cannot clear activity or requests |
| `UserPromptSubmit` with a turn ID | Working; a new turn can replace idle or response-ready state when no requests remain |
| First submit without a turn ID | Working provisionally; later events cannot be correlated to that turn |
| Repeated submit for current turn | Leave state and deadline unchanged |
| New turn while another turn works or has unresolved input | Unknown: `overlapping_turns` |
| Non-question `PreToolUse` | Working only for a matching current turn with no pending requests |
| Question opening or approval request | Add or merge the request; a missing turn baseline makes the session unknown |
| Matching `PostToolUse` | Remove that request; working if no requests remain |
| Unmatched `PostToolUse` while requests remain | Unknown: `uncorrelated_resolution`; retain requests |
| `Stop` with matching current turn | Response ready; clear that turn's requests |
| `Stop` without matching current turn | Unknown: `uncorrelated_stop`; retain requests |
| Tool activity or input for a turn already marked response ready | Unknown: `activity_after_stop` |

Question notices take priority over approval notices when both are pending.
Unknown state stays unknown for the current turn, even if another same-turn event arrives.
A matching resolution can remove its request while leaving the session unknown.
A fresh submit with a different, unseen turn ID can establish a new baseline only when no requests remain.
Retire the previous turn when accepting that new baseline.
Unknown state cannot prove that old input was resolved.
These rules intentionally prefer missing an activity indication over presenting a conflicting observation as current.

## Freshness and bounded memory

These are initial policy values, rather than measured transport performance.
Changing them requires updating this contract and its cases together.

| Bound | Value | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Raw hook stdin | 262144 bytes | Drop oversized input before projection |
| Wire frame, including LF | 16384 bytes | Reject before allocating a larger frame |
| JSON object depth | 2 | Reject deeper input |
| Maximum delivery age | 30000 ms | Reject older helper observations |
| Allowed future clock difference | 2000 ms | Reject observations further ahead |
| Observation freshness | 120000 ms | Expire idle, working, input, and response-ready observations to unknown |
| Sessions per app run | 128 | Refuse new session keys; do not evict a live session or terminal record |
| Event IDs per session | 4096 | Set that session unknown at capacity; refuse further unseen events until app restart |
| Distinct turn IDs per session | 256 | Set unknown at capacity; refuse further unseen events until app restart |
| Pending requests per session | 64 | Set unknown at capacity; retain existing requests without evicting one |

At receipt, record local wall time and monotonic time separately.
Reject an observation older than 30000 ms or more than 2000 ms in the future.
Compute initial age as `max(0, receipt_wall_ms - observed_at_ms)`.
Set the deadline to `receipt_monotonic_ms + 120000 - initial_age`.
At the deadline, make the observation unknown and retain requests as unconfirmed.
No heartbeat has been verified, so a long-running command can become unknown after two minutes.
That is a stated first-version limitation, not proof of failure or termination.

Duplicate IDs, repeated submits or stops, merged request openings, unmatched completions, and rejected messages do not extend freshness.
When the app sleeps, expire all nonterminal observations on wake before showing them again.
A backward wall-clock change or a discontinuous clock makes observations unknown until new evidence arrives.
A later valid message must still satisfy the ordering rules.

At app launch, start with an empty live store. Never restore working state from disk.
On reconnect, do not replay stored activity. The helper keeps no spool or session history.
Known ended sessions remain ended until app exit, except the repeated-start ambiguity described above.
A new app process has no knowledge of earlier terminal records and must label new observations provisionally.

## Socket lifecycle and failure behavior

Use `/private/tmp/notch-pet-<uid>/events-v1.sock`, outside the repository.
`<uid>` is the current user's numeric ID.
The app owns the directory with mode `0700` and socket with mode `0600`.
Verify directory ownership and type; refuse a symlink or an unexpected owner.
Both endpoints check that the peer has the same user ID.
Same-user access does not authenticate the provider. The app must never authorize agent actions.

Only the app creates the listening socket.
Never unlink an arbitrary existing path. Recover only an owned socket after establishing that no listener is active.
Detailed socket race handling belongs to bridge implementation and verification.

Each connection carries one message. Read at most one bounded frame, then close the connection.
Reject extra bytes if they are already buffered after LF. Never process a second frame on that connection.
Bytes sent after closure cannot create another event.
The receiver handles fragmented reads until LF, its size limit, or its deadline.
A truncated frame, invalid object, unsupported version, or read timeout makes no store change.
There is no version fallback and no negotiation.

| Deadline | Limit |
|---|---|
| Helper stdin read | 50 ms |
| Helper connect | 50 ms |
| Helper write | 50 ms |
| Total helper operation after executable entry | 250 ms, including parsing and cleanup |
| Receiver frame read after accept | 100 ms total, not reset by each byte |

Enforce a single total helper deadline as well as the phase deadlines.
Process launch time is outside that executable deadline and still needs adapter measurement.
There is one connection attempt and no retry, acknowledgement, queue, or disk spool.
An absent app, busy socket, broken connection, parse error, or timeout drops the message.
A successful write does not prove that the app applied the message.

For every handled failure, the hook helper returns exit `0` with empty stdout.
It must never output an approval result, change an agent decision, or send terminal input.
Routine stderr is also empty. Optional diagnostics use fixed reason codes without payloads or source identifiers.
The future setup task must also bound execution through each agent's hook configuration.
These are implementation requirements; this documentation task does not test real process deadlines.

## Version changes and checks

Reject any version other than integer `1`, including boolean `true`.
Version 1 rejects new fields and hook names; coordinate any wire extension through a new version.
Keep the socket suffix aligned with the wire version.
Do not reinterpret old version-1 fields after deployment.

The [fictional cases](agent-events-v1-cases.json) contain no captured session data.
Run `python3 scripts/check-event-contract.py` from the repository root.
It checks message validation and a small reference state model against independent expected results.
The checker is a design aid, not the production parser, adapter, or store.
The next tasks must test their actual implementations against these same requirements.
